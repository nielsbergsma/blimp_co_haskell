# Blimp&Co - Haskell

This codebase is a re-implementation of the Elm "backoffice" web application, found [here](https://github.com/nielsbergsma/blimp_co_elm/tree/main/frontend/backoffice), in Haskell. It was developed for a Medium article that explores how to apply Domain-Driven Design in an edge-computing environment. More details are covered in the article.

**Note:** This codebase originated as a fork of [ghc-wasm-miso-examples](https://github.com/tweag/ghc-wasm-miso-examples).

## Implementation

This project uses the [GHC WebAssembly backend](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2022-11-22-wasm-backend-merged-in-ghc/) with [MISO](https://haskell-miso.org/) and [jsaddle-wasm](https://github.com/amesgen/jsaddle-wasm) to produce browser-compatible WebAssembly. [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is used for styling.

The structure closely follows its Elm counterpart and results in a Single-Page Application (SPA). The source directory is organized as follows:

- **Pages**: Top-level pages.
- **Components**: Reusable components, both stateful and stateless.
- **Data**: Records, decoders, and functions for communication with external sources.

### JavaScript Interoperability

The code uses `foreign import javascript` and `foreign export javascript` statements for interoperation with the JavaScript environment. For instance:

- [src/Routes.hs](src/Routes.hs) contains the applicationâ€™s routing logic.
- [js/routing.js](js/routing.js) serves as its JavaScript counterpart.

This application also demonstrates the use of HTML Web Components. See [js/components.js](js/components.js) for details.

## Live Demonstration

A hosted version of the application is available at [https://backoffice-hs.software-craftsmen.dev](https://backoffice-hs.software-craftsmen.dev).

The resulting WebAssembly file is 3.4 MB (uncompressed) and 940 KB (compressed with zstd). It works in all recent major browsers.

## Installation

To install dependencies, first install the NIX package manager on your system. Then, run the following commands:

```shell
nix develop
wasm32-wasi-cabal update
make build@debug
```

## Run Locally

To start a local HTTP server and view the application, run:

```shell
make serve
```
